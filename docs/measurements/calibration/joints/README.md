# Encoder Calibration

This folder contains encoder calibration data for the Exapod leg joints.

Calibration is performed on each leg individually.  
For clarity, detailed plots are provided for **one representative prototype leg only**.

**Encoders**
- Tibia & Femur: AS5600  
- Coxa: MT6835  

**Mechanical configuration**
- Tibia & Femur: 1:2 lever mechanism  
- Coxa: direct drive  

Data is used to verify joint linearity and servo-to-angle mapping for kinematic modeling.
